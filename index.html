	<p> Being the latest installment from the game developer Bungie, Destiny has become widely popular worldwide as well as a personal favorite of mine. In the game of Destiny there are tiered weapons, the most difficult to obtain being the "exotic" tiered weapons. This web page will be a guide to obtain one of the most coveted exotic weapons in Destiny, "Sleeper Simulant."</p>
	<p> The first part of receiving the Sleeper Simulant is actually based on pure luck. In order to start you need to have found four DAVLIN-RAS8711-FR002's and dismantle them. They randomly drop from enemies and in my experience the drop rate occured rather frequently. The dismantling of the DAVLIN-RAS8711-FR002's will proct a mission titled "The First Firewall." After completing this mission your will be given an item named "The Curious Transceiver." This will ask for you to input four codes which are provided below. </p>
	<p> This marked the end of the easy part of the quest to the Sleeper Simulant for me. The game asks you speedrun "Shadow Call" in under 4 minutes. This will give you the IKELOS Fusion Core which require five components. Three of the components require you to wait in three different planets for a "Defend the WARSAT" public event. This could take you minutes, or in my case, hours. Below I have provided a table of where to have a higher chance at finding the WARSATs on each planet. After completing the IKELOS Fusion Core, the final step is to complete a run of "The Fallen S.A.B.E.R." Wait until the next wednesday in real time to receive your hard earned Sleeper Simulant. Below I have also attatched a link to facilitate locating the specific spots on each planet. </p>
